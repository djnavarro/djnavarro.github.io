title: "About me"

Hi there! I'm Danielle Navarro. I'm a data scientist, generative artist, and a recovering academic living in Sydney with my two kids and a Netflix subscription. Once upon a time I was a mathematical psychologist. After that I was developer advocate and occasional software engineer. I've sometimes been accused of being a statistician.
